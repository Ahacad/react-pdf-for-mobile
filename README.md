### react-pdf-mobile

Read pdf easily on mobile.

### How to use

Clone the repo, install the dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`. Make a new directory called `dist`, put pdf books inside `dist/books`. You may have depth-1 categories now.


```

```

Run `yarn build`, and you will have all the files bundled (using webpack) inside the `dist` directory. Push this directory to your server, and you shall see the links now!
